# TempAndRHRdata

peakdetect.py and analytic_wfm.py and test.py from https://gist.github.com/sixtenbe/1178136

Temp and RHR August 2016.py is correlating my Resting Heart Rate (data collected from my FitBit Charge HR) and my morning body temperature (data taken each morning, oral thermometer). 

Correlation between days with max temperature and max resting heart rate is good (0.998), after cleaning the data for dates without temperature or heart rate readings and days where the temperature was discarded for some reason.
